webapp for the COSACO initiative of La Romana, Dominican Republic (el sitio del la colaboraci√≥n de COSACO de La Romana, Republica Dominicana)


## main goals and technolgies:

- to start this will be a [`golang`](http://golang.org) driven web app, which will allow future expansion into an API backend which can serve several frontends (mobile apps, web apps, etc.) for data-sharing and collaboration functionalities later on
- this whole thing will be rolled out in a interative way, so from step 1 we will have zero downtime upgrades built in
- as more features get added the binary will be seamlessly updated

- see ideas [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12b7MaSla2uKhMK9sewEevJHai1DO84s9vq3e-SUWU1c/edit?usp=sharing)
