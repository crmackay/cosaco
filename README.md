# cosaco
webapp for the COSACO initiative of La Romana, Dominican Republic (el sitio del la colaboraci√≥n de COSACO de La Romana, Republica Dominicana)


## main goals and technolgies:

- to start this will be a [`golang`](golang.org) driven web app, which will allow future expansion into an API backend which can serve several frontends (mobile apps, web apps, etc.) for data-sharing and collaboration functionalities later on
- this whole thing will be rolled out in a interative way, so from step 1 we will have zero downtime upgrades built in
- as more features get added the binary will be seamlessly updated

### features:

- version 0.1:
  - graceful restart (when new binaries are loaded to the server)
    - set up githook that pulls, builds, find the PID for the current server and kills it
    - use [endless](https://github.com/fvbock/endless) to gracefully reload
  - homepage
  - i18n (Spanish and English, with translator-editable files)
  - store team information in flat-files
    - toml files
    - watch for updates and update the database entry upon change [use fsnotify](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/fsnotify.v1)
    - when a change happens, update datatase
  - database of team info (via [BoltDB](http://npf.io/2014/07/intro-to-boltdb-painless-performant-persistence/))
  - members page
    - a page for each member, with details, contact info etc.
